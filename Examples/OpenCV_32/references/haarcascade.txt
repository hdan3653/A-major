HAAR-TRAINING
- Frame Capture / Count
-- 1000 to 3000 minimum

- Outer Rectangle
-- Red: Not capturing
-- Green: Capturing / Saving
-- Yellow: Capturing / Not saving

- Detection Rectangle
-- Visible: Face detected (blue: Training || yellow: Testing)
-- Hidden: Face not detected

- Instructions
-- 1. Spacebar: Start / stop capturing.
--- saves captured frames to folder: binaries/trained/positives
--- creates file: binaries/trained/pos_train.txt
--- press the [ X ] KEY to start over
-- 2. [ S ] KEY: Create samples file.
--- briefly opens a command window
--- creates file: binaries/trained/positives.vec
--- can still capture more frames, but samples file (positives.vec) will be deleted and need recreating
--- press the [ X ] KEY to start over
-- 3. [ T ] KEY: Create training file.
--- closes the main program window
--- opens a command window
--- creates folder: binaries/haarcascade_frontalface_JHPJHP
--- creates file: binaries/haarcascade_frontalface_JHPJHP.xml
--- can take an extremely long time to complete
-- 4. [ H ] KEY: Switch to test mode.
--- only available after the file has been created: binaries/haarcascade_frontalface_JHPJHP.xml
--- uses the newly created classifier to recognize a face
-- 5. [ P ] KEY: Test performance.
--- only available after the file has been created: binaries/haarcascade_frontalface_JHPJHP.xml
--- creates folder: binaries/trained/tests
--- merges the first captured image file with all the negative images, testing performance and accuracy

- Information
-- choosing a capture location (Browse For Folder), the default location must be used: binaries/trained/positives
-- if Cancel is pressed while choosing a capture location, all created files including previous captures will be deleted
-- if the detection rectangle falls on or outside the outer rectangle capturing is paused
-- frame count and outside rectangle only show in training mode (default) not testing mode
-- capturing can continue after the main window had closed then reopened, adding to previous captured frames
